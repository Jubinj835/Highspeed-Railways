In this project, I used Python to analyze a real-world dataset on high-speed railway operations. 

I used list comprehensions to load and concatenate daily railway operation datasets.
Used FOR loops and if/else control flow to clean and prep the data.
Analyzed the impact of holidays, distance, and weather on railway delays.

Along the way, I practiced common data science tasks like
- cleaning string data and fixing data types.
- concatenating datasets split across multiple files.
- identifying and correcting inconsistencies between data files.
